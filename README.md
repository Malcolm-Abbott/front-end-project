# Game Repository

A web application for gamers who want to access game information.

### Motive Behind Game Repository

As this is my first web application built, I decided that I wanted to be ambitious in my first endeavor. I wanted to build a website that would retrieve and display video, image, and textual information from a third party API and display them on one nice looking layout.
